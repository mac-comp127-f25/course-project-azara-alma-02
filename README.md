# PieHollow
Alma Capone and Azara Cunningham

Project Description: 
Pie Hollow is an interactive game where the user collects ingredients from various locations on the map and then utilizes a kitchen to make a pie and sell it at their friend’s bakesale. 
To run this game the user must have Java 17/21. The game is played by running the PieHollow class. 
We would like to acknowledge the help we received from Professor Drake in figuring out how to make the baker move. In terms of outside of class resources we used a variety of stock images as well as remove.Bg to remove their backgrounds. We also made a free acount on Inkarnate.com to create the map background of PieHollow.

Societal Impact:
Our project does not lend itself towards negative uses, and does not contain many opportunities for unintended consequences. However, our project is not fully accessible as it is not playable by visually impaired people, and potentially not by those with motor control difficulties.
